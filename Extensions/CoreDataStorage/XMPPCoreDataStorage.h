/**
 * This class provides an optional base class that may be used to implement
 * a CoreDataStorage class for an xmpp extension (or perhaps any core data storage class).
 * 
 * It operates on its own dispatch queue which allows it to easily provide storage for multiple extension instance.
 * More importantly, it smartly buffers its save operations to maximize performance!
 * 
 * It does this using two techniques:
 * 
 * First, it monitors the number of pending requests.
 * When a operation is requested of the class, it increments an atomic variable, and schedules the request.
 * After the request has been processed, it decrements the atomic variable.
 * At this point it knows if there are other pending requests,
 * and it uses the information to decide if it should save now,
 * or postpone the save operation until the pending requests have been executed.
 * 
 * Second, it monitors the number of unsaved changes.
 * Since NSManagedObjectContext retains any changed objects until they are saved to disk
 * it is an important memory management concern to keep the number of changed objects within a healthy range.
 * This class uses a configurable saveThreshold to save at appropriate times.
 * 
 * This class also offers several useful features such as
 * preventing multiple instances from using the same database file (conflict)
 * and caching of xmppStream.myJID to improve performance.
 * 
 * For more information on how to extend this class,
 * please see the XMPPCoreDataStorageProtected.h header file.
 * 
 * The framework comes with several classes that extend this base class such as:
 * - XMPPRosterCoreDataStorage       (Extensions/Roster)
 * - XMPPCapabilitiesCoreDataStorage (Extensions/XEP-0115)
 * - XMPPvCardCoreDataStorage        (Extensions/XEP-0054)
 * 
 * Feel free to skim over these as reference implementations.

 * NSManagedObjectContext is a light-weight thread-UNsafe component of the CoreData stack.
 * Thus a managedObjectContext should only be accessed from a single thread, or from a serialized queue.
 * 
 * A managedObjectContext is associated with a persistent store.
 * In most cases the persistent store is an sqlite database file.
