/**
 * The XMPPRoster provides the scaffolding for a roster solution.
 * It handles the basics of the xmpp roster communication,
 * and leaves the rest up to the xmppRosterStorage classes.
 * 
 * You are free to extend, change, customize, or tweak the sample storage classes that come with the framework:
 * XMPPRosterMemoryStorage
 * XMPPRosterCoreDataStorage
 * 
 * You can also completely implment your own roster storage class if you'd like.
 * The point of all this customizability is simple:
 *   The roster is the component of the xmpp stack that is most often customized for a particular application.
 * 
 * 
 * Inter-Module Interaction:
 * 
 * If you use XMPPvCardAvatarModule, the roster will automatically support user photos.

/**
 * In traditional IM applications, the "buddy" system is rather straightforward.
 * User A sends a request to become "friends" with user B.
 * User B accepts the friend request.
 * And now user A and B appear in each other's roster.
 * 
 * But, internally, XMPP presence actually works more like twitter.
 * User A sends a presence subscription request to user B.
 * Think about this more like following on twitter.
 * User A is requesting permission to receive presence information from user B (following their presence).
 * User B can accept this request, but may not be interested in receiving presence info from user B.
 * Again, this is more like twitter following, but with the addition of required permission.
 * So when user B accepts the request, this *only* means that user A will receive presence from user B.
 * It does *not* mean that user B will receive presence from user A.
 * Again, twitter-style, user A is now "following" user B.
 * In diagram form, presence is flowing like this:
 * 
 *   A <-- B
 * 
 * Now, if B also wants to receive presence from user A, then user B must request this permission.
 * And furthermore, user A must accept the request.
 * Just because B has granted A permission to receive presence,
 * doesn't mean that B gets a free pass to receive presence from A.
 * Presence always requires permission.
 * 
 * This property does the following:
 * If a presence subscription request is received from user X,
 * and user X has already been added to our roster (is a "known" user),
 * then the presence subscription request is automatically accepted.
 * 
 * Continuing the example from above, if we were user A, and we've already added B to our roster,
 * then if B sends a presence susbcription request, we'll auto accept it.
 * 
 * This makes the roster act more like traditional IM applications.
 * 
 * The default value is YES.

 * 
 * In this mode, the roster module will automatically create a user once a presence is received,
 * if the user has never been seen before.
