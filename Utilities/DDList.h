/**
 * The DDList class is designed as a simple list class.
 * It can store objective-c objects as well as non-objective-c pointers.
 * It does not retain objective-c objects as it treats all elements as simple pointers.
 * 
 * Example usages:
 * - Storing a list of delegates, where there is a desire to not retain the individual delegates.
 * - Storing a list of dispatch timers, which are not NSObjects, and cannot be stored in NSCollection classes.
 * 
 * This class is NOT thread-safe.
 * It is designed to be used within a thread-safe context (e.g. within a single dispatch_queue).
