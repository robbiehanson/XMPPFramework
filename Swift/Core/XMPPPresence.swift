public extension XMPPPresence {
    /// The 'type' attribute of a presence stanza is OPTIONAL. A presence stanza that does not possess a 'type' attribute is used to signal to the server that the sender is online and available for communication. If included, the 'type' attribute specifies a lack of availability, a request to manage a subscription to another entity's presence, a request for another entity's current presence, or an error related to a previously-sent presence stanza. If included, the 'type' attribute MUST have one of the following values
    enum PresenceType: String {
        /// Signals that the entity is no longer available for communication.
        case unavailable
        /// The sender wishes to subscribe to the recipient's presence.
        case subscribe
        /// The sender has allowed the recipient to receive their presence.
        case subscribed
        /// The sender is unsubscribing from another entity's presence.
        case unsubscribe
        /// The subscription request has been denied or a previously-granted subscription has been cancelled.
        case unsubscribed
        ///  A request for an entity's current presence; SHOULD be generated only by a server on behalf of a user.

        case dnd
