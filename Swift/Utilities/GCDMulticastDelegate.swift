/**
 * This helper makes it slightly easier to call the MulticastDelegate
 * with the caveat that you must create an empty GCDMulticastDelegate class extension
 * for the protocols you'd like it to handle.
 *
 * For example, in a XMPPModule subclass called XMPPBookmarksModule
 * with a multicast delegate called XMPPBookmarksDelegate, somewhere
 * you will need to create an empty class extension like this:
 *
 * extension GCDMulticastDelegate: XMPPBookmarksDelegate {}
 *
 * This will prevent your code from crashing during the forced cast.
