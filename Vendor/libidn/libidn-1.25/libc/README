Libidn libc/README -- Instructions for building as a GNU Libc add-on.
Copyright (C) 2003-2012 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

GNU Libidn is now part of GNU Libc, so the stand-alone patch and
instructions that were distributed here before has been removed.

See getaddrinfo-idn.txt for the write-up of the API that is used in
Libc.

Simply build Libc as you would normally, but specify "libidn" as an
add-on, as in --enable-add-ons=libidn to configure.

Once installed, you may build and run the sample still distributed in
this directory, perhaps as follows:

$ gcc -o example example.c -L/usr/local/glibc/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/glibc/lib -nostdinc -I/usr/local/glibc/include -I/usr/include -I/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.95.4/include
$ CHARSET=iso-8859-1 ./example
locale charset `iso-8859-1'
gettaddrinfo(räksmörgås.josefsson.org):
address `217.13.230.178'
canonical name `178.230.13.217.in-addr.dgcsystems.net'
$

Internally the domain name xn--rksmrgs-5wao1o.josefsson.org is looked
up in DNS.
