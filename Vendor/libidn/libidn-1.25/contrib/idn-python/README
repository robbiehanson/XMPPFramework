*** Note that as of version 2.3 Python has native IDN support, see
*** <http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.2/lib/module-encodings.idna.html>.

This is a Python interface over Simon Josefsson's libidn
<URL:http://josefsson.org/libidn/>.

To install, be sure you have libidn installed, check the Makefile, and
type "make" and "make install".

Sample use:

import idn
print idn.idn2ace("Caf√©"); # The string must be in UTF-8

With a conversion to UTF-8 first, assuming your locale is Latin-1:

import idn
name = sys.argv[1]
ustring = unicode(name, "Latin-1")
print idn.idn2ace(ustring.encode("UTF-8"))
