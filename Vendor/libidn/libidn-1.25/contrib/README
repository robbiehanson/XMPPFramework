Libidn contrib/README -- Notes for the contrib/ subdirectory.
Copyright (C) 2003-2012 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

The idn-python/ sub-directory contains a Python interface for Libidn,
contributed by Stephane Bortzmeyer <bortzmeyer@nic.fr>.  It is
licensed under the same licence as Libidn itself.  Note that as of
version 2.3 Python has native IDN support, see
<http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.2/lib/module-encodings.idna.html>.

The web/ sub-directory contains a online libidn interface in PHP.

The java/ sub-directory builds Java *.class files that implement the
Libidn API.  Note!  It is unfinished and left as a proof of concept.
A developer with knowledge about Java is encouraged to take over it.

The doxygen/ sub-directory builds Doxygen documentation (HTML,
LaTeX/PDF and MAN).  Simply invoke "doxygen" in that directory and it
should build the documentation.
