Libidn README -- Notes for the JAVA API proof of concept.
Copyright (C) 2003-2012 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

This directory builds Java *.class files that implement the Libidn
API.  Note!  It is unfinished and left as a proof of concept.  A
developer with knowledge about Java is encouraged to take over it.

The current Makefile.am require GCJ.  It was tested with Sun JDK 1.1
and IBM JDK 1.1.8 too, after replacing "gcj" with "javac" and "gcjh"
with "javah" in Makefile.am.  Some combinations of compilation with
one package and executing using another package (e.g., compile with
GCJ, run with Sun's JRE) also seemed to work.

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ make ExampleIDNA
$ gij ExampleIDNA räksmörgås
xn--rksmrgs-5wao1o
$ 

Please let me know if you want to finish and maintain the Java API
glue.  It may involve some tedious work initially, but could be useful
for Java developers.

Eventually I think the Java API Glue functions should be merged into
libidn, instead of having a separate libidn-java library.
