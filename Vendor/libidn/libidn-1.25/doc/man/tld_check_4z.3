.SH NAME
tld_check_4z \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <tld.h>
.sp
.BI "int tld_check_4z(const uint32_t * " in ", size_t * " errpos ", const Tld_table ** " overrides ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const uint32_t * in" 12
Zero\-terminated array of unicode code points to process.
.IP "size_t * errpos" 12
Position of offending character is returned here.
.IP "const Tld_table ** overrides" 12
A \fBTld_table\fP array of additional domain restriction
structures that complement and supersede the built\-in information.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Test each of the code points in \fIin\fP for whether or not they are
allowed by the information in \fIoverrides\fP or by the built\-in TLD
restriction data. When data for the same TLD is available both
internally and in \fIoverrides\fP, the information in \fIoverrides\fP takes
precedence. If several entries for a specific TLD are found, the
first one is used.  If \fIoverrides\fP is \fBNULL\fP, only the built\-in
information is used.  The position of the first offending character
is returned in \fIerrpos\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the \fBTld_rc\fP value \fBTLD_SUCCESS\fP if all code
points are valid or when \fItld\fP is null, \fBTLD_INVALID\fP if a
character is not allowed, or additional error codes on general
failure conditions.
