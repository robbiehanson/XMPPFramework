@deftypefun {int} {pr29_8z} (const char * @var{in})
@var{in}: zero terminated input UTF-8 string.

Check the input to see if it may be normalized into different
strings by different NFKC implementations, due to an anomaly in the
NFKC specifications.

@strong{Return value:} Returns the @code{Pr29_rc} value @code{PR29_SUCCESS} on success,
and @code{PR29_PROBLEM} if the input sequence is a "problem sequence"
(i.e., may be normalized into different strings by different
implementations), or @code{PR29_STRINGPREP_ERROR} if there was a
problem converting the string from UTF-8 to UCS-4.
