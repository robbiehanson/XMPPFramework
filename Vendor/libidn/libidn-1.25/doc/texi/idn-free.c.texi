@deftypefun {void} {idn_free} (void * @var{ptr})
@var{ptr}: memory region to deallocate, or @code{NULL}.

Deallocates memory region by calling @code{free()}.  If @code{ptr} is @code{NULL} no
operation is performed.

Normally applications de-allocate strings allocated by libidn by
calling @code{free()} directly.  Under Windows, different parts of the
same application may use different heap memory, and then it is
important to deallocate memory allocated within the same module
that allocated it.  This function makes that possible.
