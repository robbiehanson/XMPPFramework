@deftypefun {int} {tld_check_4t} (const uint32_t * @var{in}, size_t @var{inlen}, size_t * @var{errpos}, const Tld_table * @var{tld})
@var{in}: Array of unicode code points to process. Does not need to be
zero terminated.

@var{inlen}: Number of unicode code points.

@var{errpos}: Position of offending character is returned here.

@var{tld}: A @code{Tld_table} data structure representing the restrictions for
which the input should be tested.

Test each of the code points in @code{in} for whether or not
they are allowed by the data structure in @code{tld}, return
the position of the first character for which this is not
the case in @code{errpos}.

@strong{Return value:} Returns the @code{Tld_rc} value @code{TLD_SUCCESS} if all code
points are valid or when @code{tld} is null, @code{TLD_INVALID} if a
character is not allowed, or additional error codes on general
failure conditions.
