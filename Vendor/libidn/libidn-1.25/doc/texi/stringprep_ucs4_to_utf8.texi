@var{str}: a UCS-4 encoded string

@var{len}: the maximum length of @code{str} to use. If @code{len} < 0, then
the string is terminated with a 0 character.

@var{items_read}: location to store number of characters read read, or @code{NULL}.

@var{items_written}: location to store number of bytes written or @code{NULL}.
The value here stored does not include the trailing 0
byte.

Convert a string from a 32-bit fixed width representation as UCS-4.
to UTF-8. The result will be terminated with a 0 byte.

@strong{Return value:} a pointer to a newly allocated UTF-8 string.
This value must be deallocated by the caller.
If an error occurs, @code{NULL} will be returned.
