@deftypefun {int} {pr29_4} (const uint32_t * @var{in}, size_t @var{len})
@var{in}: input array with unicode code points.

@var{len}: length of input array with unicode code points.

Check the input to see if it may be normalized into different
strings by different NFKC implementations, due to an anomaly in the
NFKC specifications.

@strong{Return value:} Returns the @code{Pr29_rc} value @code{PR29_SUCCESS} on success,
and @code{PR29_PROBLEM} if the input sequence is a "problem sequence"
(i.e., may be normalized into different strings by different
implementations).
