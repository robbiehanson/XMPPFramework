#ifndef SIGNATURE_CHECK

/* Check that the function FN takes the specified arguments ARGS with
   a return type of RET.  This header is designed to be included after
   <config.h> and the one system header that is supposed to contain
   the function being checked, but prior to any other system headers
   that are necessary for the unit test.  Therefore, this file does
   not include any system headers, nor reference anything outside of
   the macro arguments.  For an example, if foo.h should provide:

   extern int foo (char, float);

   then the unit test named test-foo.c would start out with:

   #include <config.h>
   #include <foo.h>
   #include "signature.h"
   SIGNATURE_CHECK (foo, int, (char, float));
   #include <other.h>
   ...
