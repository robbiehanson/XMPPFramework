Libidn TODO -- Future directions.
Copyright (C) 2002-2012 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

If you like to start working on anything, please let me know so work
duplication can be avoided.

  - Optimize stringprep for speed, the table searching is slow (but
    does it matter?).
  - Optimize for size?  The stringprep tables can be compressed _alot_
    (most map entries are simply zeroes).
  - Port applications to use libidn.
  - Include more stringprep profiles.
  - Improve IDN tool.
  - Reimplement punycode without string length restrictions.
  - Reject invalid Unicode data.
